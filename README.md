Here I made a simple circuit using Ultrasonic Wave Sensor having Four Pins connected with Arduino
I also connected two LED's (i.e: Green & Red) with the Arduino which detect the distance measured by Ultrasonic Wave Sensor (i.e: if the distance is less than 10 cm the red LED will turn on and if the distance is greater than 20 cm the green LED will turn on)
